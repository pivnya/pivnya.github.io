A small update on my modest project. (￣o￣) . z Z  

Every day is torture and reflection on unrealized ideas.   
  
What's the point of existing if you can't do what you truly want? There is nothing worse than living paycheck to paycheck, destroying your mind and body in your free time, telling yourself -- "I deserve rest, I worked so much and I can afford it". But your **j*b** is already destroying your body. There is nothing good about working for someone else without improving yourself, only to retire at 60 with a broken body.  
  
I cherish every moment when I **create**.
That includes this [website](https://pivnya.cool/), and the edits I made for my friend [Norman Lynx](https://www.youtube.com/@NormanJay7/videos). I'm also proud of the simple [Deus Ex texture mod](/mods). Even though all of this is just shitposting, the very fact that I'm improving brings me pleasure.  
  
### Dealing with the constant lack of time consists of cutting necessities. { .center }
  
Cutting down 24-hour gooning session is hard, but how much could be done in that time. There is no excuse...    
  
So, I decided to follow my own advice -- stop gooning, and do more of what I enjoy.  
My plans are:  
* increase the number of [streams](https://www.twitch.tv/pivnoy_chel) to eight per month;
* update this [website](https://pivnya.cool/) at least once a month;
* upload once a month to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@pivnoy_chel).
  
I've accumulated a lot of footage from 2023-2024, and I need to **FINALLY** do something with it.  
  
I'm still working on writing articles like this one.  
Peace out (づ￣ 3￣)づ
