Hello! Welcome to my personal web-site!  
  
I am pivnoy_chel, **aka** pivnya. A resident of Latvia and the sole mind behind this web-site. 
  
Here you will find some stuff that I make and am a fan of. Additionally, I will be posting my thoughts and reviews on media I have consumed.  
  
BTW, this site was made using HUGO and a PaperMod theme. It is currently hosted on my GitHub :3
  
I love gaming, Silent Hill, and music.   
Thank you for stopping by!
