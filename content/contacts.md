Technically, I have an account on **twitter** -- or whatever it is called today, the **X** -- but I don't use it any capacity.

### ❌ Where You Will Never Find Me

* You will never find me on *-eugh-* **Reddit**.
* I will never, ever create an account on **Meta's** platform -- **Instagram**, **Snapchat**, or any other nest for bug-people they will come up with. **NO**.
* **TikTok**. No. Funny story -- I once decided to create a **TikTok** account; however, after registration, I was immediately banned. I guess I should thank God, the universe, or the Übermensch.
