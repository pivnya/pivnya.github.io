A small visual modification that replaces the textures of JC Denton to the Dvoreckov, which I made in 2023.  
It also changes the texture of cigarettes to the Philip Morris one.  
  
I am not that proficient in modding, so this is not actually a *mod*. There is a modding scene for this game, but I wasn't able to locate modern guides, and all the software was outdated.
