I will try to answer you as soon as possible :D\n🌍 Any Sites You can find me on Discord under username @pivnoychel. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty active on this p*dophile-riddled platform.

If you wish to add me on Spotify or check my playlists, you are free to do so. Technically, I have an account on twitter \u0026ndash; or whatever it is called today, the X \u0026ndash; but I don\u0026rsquo;t use it any capacity.\nThe number of actual brainlets on this platform drives me insane. Here is a fun experiment: create a new account and don\u0026rsquo;t follow anyone. Just look at the slop that Elon feeds you. You might find it interesting!\n❌ Where You Will Never Find Me You will never find me on -eugh- Reddit. I will never, ever create an account on Meta\u0026rsquo;s platform \u0026ndash; Instagram, Snapchat, or any other nest for bug-people they will come up with. NO. TikTok. No. Funny story \u0026ndash; I once decided to create a TikTok account; however, after registration, I was immediately banned. I guess I should thank God, the universe, or the Übermensch.
