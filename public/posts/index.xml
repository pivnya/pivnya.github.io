      <description>&lt;p&gt;A small update on my small project. (￣o￣) . z Z&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day is torture and reflection on unrealized ideas. But you have to look at life more optimistically and improve yourself every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the point of existing if you can’t find the strength to do what you want? There is nothing worse than living paycheck to paycheck, destroying your mind and body in your free time, telling yourself &amp;ndash; “I deserve rest, I worked so much and I can afford it”&lt;br&gt;
But your &lt;strong&gt;j*b&lt;/strong&gt; is already destroying your body. There is nothing good about working for someone else without improving yourself, only to retire at 60 with a broken body.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In the current world, stricken by the greed of corporations, we have entered a consumerist paradise for the fans of Funko Pops™ and Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry geniuses such as Konami are ready to publish moldy products from 30 years ago onto the market out of fear and inability to create anything new, and to receive free money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal Gear Master Collection is a glorified series of ports. For Metal Gear 1 and 2, they cut out an already existing port that was available in MGS 3 Subsistence on PS2, which apparently was a mobile port, and started selling them separately.&lt;br&gt;
The game was included as a side content on a second disc for the game title!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
